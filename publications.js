With this modification, we show that we can not only address multipath interference but also enable new applications such as recovering depth of near-transparent surfaces, looking through diffusers and creating time-profile movies of sweeping light.",

Time of flight cameras are a low cost, consumer-oriented technology capable of acquiring range maps at 30 frames per second. Such cameras have a natural connection to conventional illumination multiplexing strategies as both paradigms rely on the capture of multiple shots and synchronized illumination. ",
